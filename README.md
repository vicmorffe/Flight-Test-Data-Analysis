# Flight-Test-Data-Analysis

Flight testing generates large volumes of data Did you know that a single instrumented test aircraft creates onboard data streams > 5 MB/sec, or a few gigabytes during the mission? Aerospace programs handle terabytes of data. Don't just collect the data..... what is your analysis plan?

Flight testing is all about getting the data, but flight testers need the right tools to handle the volume and complexity of data signals generated by modern instrumentation. 

Demonstrations make sense when the examples are relevant to real needs.
